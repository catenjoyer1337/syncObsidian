## Features
- **Automatic Syncing**: Syncs local folders in your vault with GitHub repositories.
- **Repository Management**: Add and remove repositories from your sync list.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Uses a `config.json` file and environment variables for easy setup.
- **Error Handling**: Handles permissions and ownership issues for smooth syncing across different machines.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/syncObsidian.git
   cd syncObsidian
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   This tool requires the GitPython library. Install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install gitpython
   ```

3. **Configure your environment**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your GitHub username and token:
   - `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username (used for API requests).
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with repo access for private repositories.
   - `VAULT_DIR`: The local directory/vault where repositories will be synced/stored.

4. **Set up `config.json`:**
   - Open the `config.json` file and adjust the placeholders as needed.

## Usage

- **Clone/Sync Repositories**
   syncObsidian will check for unsynced or untracked repositories and prompt you to clone or sync as needed.

- **Add a New Repository**
   Enter the repository name when prompted, and syncObsidian will handle the rest.

- **Remove a Repository**
   Enter the repository name to remove it from the configuration and delete its local directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error related to "dubious ownership," ensure that the repositoryâ€™s directory permissions match the user running the script. For more details, see the error message output and the [Git configuration documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config).
